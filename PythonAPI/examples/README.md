# Custom Carla PythonAPI for use with DReyeVR

These python files were primarily sourced from the Carla PythonAPI's own implementation at `carla/PythonAPI/examples` but with several important differences. 

The typical usecase for Carla is to have an empty server (the UE4 simulator instance) that various python scripts can connect to and interact with; via manipulating actors, changing world details, recording/replaying, etc. However, an important characteristic of our **DReyeVR** implementation is that the main player is an entity running within the UE4 simulator (server) to make use of Unreal's VR and Eye-Tracking support. 

Since the focus is no longer an empty client-based server, we tweaked these scripts to focus primarily on the `player0` or `spectator` player which is the VR-Ego-Vehicle-player that we implemented in our [`VR Player`](https://github.com/HARPLab/DReyeVR/wiki/2.-Setting-up-the-VR-player) setup guide.
